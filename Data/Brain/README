This Directory contains image from BRAINWEB project 
in META IMAGE file format.

The BrainWeb project home page is :

   http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb

--------------------------------------------------

The MetaImage file format is composed of a text
file header with extension .mha and a binary file
with data.

The images in this directory were created by 
downloading the binary data from the BrainWeb
page and creating a MetaImage text header for 
them using the information about the images like
number of voxels in each dimension and spacing
along each dimension. The original information 
for each image in on the .txt files.

Following these MetaImage text headers as examples
it should be relatively easy to create headers 
for other binary files of your own.
